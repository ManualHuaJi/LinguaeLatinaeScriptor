# LatinInputMethod
This project is a Latin input method, designed to make it easier to type Latin.  
### Future Plans  
1. Long vowels and accent marks
2. Spelling corrections 
3. Associative typing
4. Linux, Mac and Andorid versions (much later)  
Obviously, a Latin dictionary is needed to realize these plans.  
 Lewis & Short is a good choice, but the disadvantage is that the dictionary itself is very thick and without some streamlining it is likely to cause this project to become a behemoth.  
 In addition, new Latin words and contemporary Latin words are a very troublesome problem, as L&S may not include them.
